- **Write** your thoughts
- **Blog** your insights
- **Save** your code snippets
- **Keep** the links that spark ideas

Everything lives together. Everything connects.

## ✨ Features That Just Make Sense

### 🗂️ Project Planning That’s Not a Slog
Plan entire projects with task lists, priorities, progress tracking, and deadlines — from personal goals to team sprints.

### 🧠 Notes That Don’t Get Lost
Take notes like a second brain. Markdown-supported, searchable, and organized. From messy ideas to sharp documentation.

### ✍️ Blogging Without The Bloat
Write and publish blog posts with clean Markdown. Draft privately or share publicly with a simple URL.

### 🧩 Snippet Keeper (Because Memory Is a Lie)
Save your golden code snippets with context and clarity. Perfect for:
- Recurring setups
- Weird bug fixes you never want to Google again
- Commands or regex patterns that work once and vanish forever

Syntax highlighting, tags, and lightning-fast search.

### 🔖 Link Vault (Save the Internet)
Keep links you swear you’ll need later — and actually find them later.

Use cases:
- Tutorials you’ll finally follow
- Design inspiration
- Product docs, Stack Overflow gems, tools you don’t want to forget

Organize by topic, tag, or mood.

### 🔗 Connect It All
Turn a note into a blog.
Attach a snippet to a project.
